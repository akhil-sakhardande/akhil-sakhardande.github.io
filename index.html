Hello World!

About me: sample

I am a recent graduate student from the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kharagpur pursuing majors in Mathematics and Computer Science with micro-specialization in Optimization Theory and Applications. My interests lie in the intersection of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. More specifically, I am intrigued by the current trend in the field of Optimization, Data Analytics and Machine Learning and their application in improving our day to day lives.

I currently work as the Product Engineer, Data Engine at Sprinklr, India where I am implementing the machine learning module in the data flow execution pipeline for real-time or batch processing using Kafka, Spark, and Spring framework.
